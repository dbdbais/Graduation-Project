WINDSOR GREAT PARK
BE TICK AWARE
What are ticks and where can you find them?
Ticks are small, spider-like creatures that can carry organisms which may cause illness in humans and animals, including Lymes disease. They prefer moist areas with dense vegetation or long grass. They are usually found in woodland, grassland, moorland, heathland and can be found in parks in which deer live. Ticks are most active between late Spring and early Autumn.
Prevention.
Take these simple steps to avoid coming into contact with ticks:
•Walk on clearly defined paths.
• Avoid dense vegetation.
. Check yourself for ticks regularly.
• Use an insect repellent.
If you have been bitten.
. Remove the tick as soon as possible.
• Use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers, or a tick removal tool.
• Disinfect the tick bite.
• Keep an eye on it for several weeks for any changes and contact your GP if you feel unwell and remember to tell them that you were bitten by a tick.

BREAKING NEWS:
Greater China Media and Entertainment Corporation Signs Agreement for Joint Venture With Beijing Talent Agency, Star Agency
BEIJING, Sept. 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Greater China Media and Entertainment Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: GCME - News), a publicly traded company that has recently expanded into the media and entertainment industry in China, is pleased to announce that the Company has signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Beijing Star Agency Ltd. (""Star Agency""), a talent agency company based in Beijing.
Star Agency has headquarters in Beijing. They are specializing in promoting, training and managing signed entertainers, as well as finding and managing talent for films, TV shows and commercials. The general manager and the founder of Star Agency has over 9 years experience running TV shows and being a hostess in major TV channels in China, including CCTV and Beijing TV. At present, the entertainers signed up with Star Agency are all professionals graduated from art colleges in China. They have their own strengths and enjoy great popularity in the film and television circle. Many of them are acknowledged by famous producers, directors and specialists as new performers with great potential.
According to the letter of intent signed by the Company and Star Agency, the two companies will invest a total of US$125,000 (1 million rmb) to set up a joint venture in China. The Company will invest US$72,500 (0.6 million rmb) and own 60% of the joint venture as well as control the Board of Directors. Star Agency will invest the remaining $50,000 and own 40% of the joint venture. The joint venture will makes full use of Greater China Media & Entertainment's film, television and advertising projects, realizing the mutual benefits of sharing resources between branch and subsidiary companies and with cooperative partners. In the future, the joint venture will enlarge its business to represent directors, writers and singers, as well as performers and artists from other related fields.
The Company recently changed its name to Greater China Media and Entertainment Corporation, with the intent to enter the Chinese media and entertainment industry. In the first step towards this goal, on June 14, through a wholly owned subsidiary, the Company signed an agreement to set up a joint venture to become Greater China Film and Television Production Company. On July 29, 2006, the Company signed an agreement to set up a joint venture for Greater China Sales and Advertising Agency. The joint venture agreement with Star Agency represents the next step in the Company's involvement in the media and entertainment industry in China. The new joint venture will become Greater China Talent Agency.
A $1,000 dollar investment could yield a $5,000 dollar profit in just one trade if you trade out at the top. GCME should be one of the most profitable stocks to trade this year. In this range the stock has potential to move in either direction in big wings. This means you should be able to buy at the lows and sell at the highs for months to come.
IF YOU ARE RECEIVING THIS EMAIL, YOU ARE AMONG THE FIRST PUBLIC INVESTORS TO KNOW ABOUT GCME !!! WE WISH YOU LUCK AND REMEMBER THE SAYING, TRADE AT THE TOP!!!

A TOUS LES FRAN횉AIS
La France a perdu une bataille!
Mais la France n'a pas perdu la guerre!
Des gouvernants de rencontre ont pu capituler, c챕dant 횪 la panique, oubliant l'honneur, livrant le pays 횪 la servitude. Cependant, rien n'est perdu!
Rien n'est perdu, parce que cette guerre est une guerre mondiale. Dans l'univers libre, des forces immenses n'ont pas encore donne. Un jour, ces forces 챕craseront l'ennemi. Il faut que la France, ce jour-la, soit pr챕sente a la victoire. Alors, elle retrouvera sa libert챕 et sa grandeur. Tel est mon but, mon seul but!
Voil횪 pourquoi je convie tous les Francais, o첫 qu'ils se trouvent, 횪 s'unir 횪 moi dans l'action, dans le sacrifice et dans l'esp챕rance. Notre patrie est en p챕ril de mort. Luttons tous pour la sauver!

HELLO
My name is

Susan Rice
has a blind spot:
Genocide
Both the Jewish people's and Rwanda's.
National Security Advisor Susan Rice recently disparaged Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for raising objections to the reportedly calamitous terms of a nuclear deal with Iran that would leave that barbarous govemment within striking distance of a nuclear bomb.
Even though Israel is threatened by a genocidal Islamic Republic - which the administration is willing to trust with 6,500 or more nuclear centrifuges-Rice portrayed the Prime Minister's desperate plea for his nation's existence to a joint session of Congress on March 3rd as ""destructive"" and ripping the ""labric"" of our two nations historic bond.
""If we use the word 'genocide' and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November election?""
- SUSAN RICE ON THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE. AS QUOTED BY AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER
Rice could not be more wrong
A respected former Secretary of State George Shultz testified to the danger of an at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, He plainly
described lan's nudear ambitions: ""They don't want a nuclear weapon
for deterrence. They want a nuclear weapon to use it. On Israd.""
But Susan Rice is no stranger to questionable mischaracterization of facts. She notoriously and repeatedly misled the public about the murder of Christopher Stevens, America's Ambassador to Libya, by blaming a third-rate web video rather than an orchestrated al-Qaeda ambush
Rice also considered it appropriate to forbid larael from criticizing John Kerry, tweeting: ""Personal attacks in Israel directed at Sec Kerry totally unfounded and unacceptable."" Apparently, Israels national point of view must be deared with Susan Rice first. But there is a much more serious and disturbing reason Susan Rice's attack on the Prime Minister of Israel merits special condemnation: her pattem of callous disregard for genocide.
In 1995, as a member of President Clinton's National Security team, Susan Rice stood by the horrific genooide in Rwanda, where over 800,000 men, women and children were hacked to death in the fastest slaughter of human beings ever recorded. Samantha Power, Susan Rice's successor as the US. Ambassador to the United Nations, condemned Rice and her Clinton administration colleagues in a 2001 article as ""bystanders to genocide."" She quoted Rice as saying ""If we use the word 'genocide"" and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November (congressional election?"" Amore lamentable statement from an American official regarding mass murder has seldom ever been uttered Rice and her team went on to impede UN action against the Rwandan genocide and minimize public opposition to American inaction by removing words like ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing from government communications on the subject. Now Susan Rice attacks the democratically-elected leader of the Jewish State for objecting to being treated like Czechoslovakia in 1938. Even though Israel was not invited to the nuclear negotiations with the enemy whose national motto is ""Death to America! Death to Israel,"" Rice condescendingly scolds its Prime Minister for simply speaking up.
Ms. Rice may be bind to the issue of genocide, but she should treat our aly with at least as much diplomatic courtesy as she does the committed enemy of both our nations.

Punography
I tried to catch some Fog. I mist. When chemists die, they barium.
Jokes about German sausage are the wurst. A soldier who survived mustard gas and pepper spray is now a seasoned veteran. I know a guy who's addicted to brake fluid. He says he can stop anytime. How does Moses make his tea? Hebrews it. I stayed up all night to see where the sun went. Than it dawned on me. This girl said she recognized me from the vegetarian club, but I'd never met herbivore.
I'm reading a book about anti-gravity. I can't put it down.
I did a theatrical performance about puns. It was a play on words.
They told me I had type A blood, but it was a Type O.
A dyslexic man walks into a bra.
PMS jokes aren't funny. Period.
Why were the Indians here first? They had reservations.
Class trip to the Coca-Cola factory. I hope there's no pop quiz.
Energizer Bunny arrested: Charged with battery.
I didn't like my beard at first. Then it grew
on me.
How do you make holy water? Boil the hell out of it!
What do you call a dinosaur with a
extensive vocabulary? A thesaurus.
When you get a bladder infection, urine trouble.

MOV 29 2004
Dear Senator Dodd,
This is in response to your November 15 letter on behalf of Sohail Husain concerning the plight of religious minorities in Bangladesh, including the Ahmadiya community.
We are deeply concerned by reports of violence and persecution, often directed against religious minorities, in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has long been plagued by political-criminal violence that is symptomatic of its weak rule of law and insufficient attention paid by its leaders to guaranteeing human rights for groups of all religious and ethnic backgrounds. We continue to press the Government to do all it can to bring the violence to an end, to ensure that all perpetrators are apprehended and brought to justice, and to ensure security and religious freedom for members of all of Bangladesh's religious communities.
In particular, we continue to be extremely alarmed by the increased attacks on the Ahmadiya community, and the strong pressure on the Governinent of Bangladesh to declare Ahmadis non-Muslims and to severely curtail their religious rights. Embassy Dhaka made religious freedom a central point of discussion in most meetings with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Home Minister, and several other ministers beginning in December 2003. In fact, US intervention was key in recently preventing the government from declaring Ahmadis non-Muslims.

PROPERTY 57
Negotiations founder for Donnelly Queensland
Mark Phillips
The developers of The Foundry, a mixed-use property in Melbourne's Bourke Street, will put it back on the market for about $130 million after lengthy negotiations with a potential buyer broke down.
A joint venture of Japanese fund manager daVinci Advisors and Multiplex Developments had been in exclusive negotiations for the property for several months, but could not agree on terms with the developers, Donnelly Group.
Under a complex deal, daVinci would have acquired the four-level shopping centre and 243-bay car park for more than $100 million, and Multiplex was interested in the site at the rear of the complex, which carry permits for either residential or commercial development.
It is understood that while da Vinci was keen to proceed with the acquisition, the new Canadian owners of Multiplex, private equity firm Brookfield Asset Management, vetoed the deal partly because of concerns about global credit.
Donnelly Group director Stephen Donnelly said the four parts of the property would now be re- advertised for separate sale.
""We have exhausted that process and it's going back to what our original plans were really,"" he said. A spokesman for da Vinci declined to comment.
The Foundry was completed and opened for business in the second half of last year. Jones Lang LaSalle managed an expressions of interest campaign in September for the

It includes 6200 square metres of retail space anchored by a Supa IGA supermarket and 38 specialty
retail tenancies.
Also completed are 92 residen- tial apartments and the car park, which is operated by Premier Park- ing.
Also to be sold is a Little Collins Street site, with planning approval for a 38 level office building with 25,570 sq m of net lettable area, or a 62 level residential tower with up to 430 apartments.
""We will probably move on the residential pretty quickly because. the market is strong,"" Mr Donnelly said.
Combined, the four elements. could be worth up to $130 million, with the highest value on the retail component at about $45 million.
Mr Kaufman said there had been strong interest for individual com- ponents last year, but the decision had been made to sell the property whole.
The Foundry is near the intersec tion of Bourke and Elizabeth streets and adjacent to the Galleria shop- ping centre, with two street front ages.

Rio office to relocate
Lisa Allen
Global mining giant Rio Tinto has decided to amalgamate its Queensland offices into one Brisbane address, leasing the majority of DB RREEF's proposed $350 million office tower.
In the deal, foreshadowed by The Australian Financial Review last September, Rio Tinto will relocate from several blue-chip Brisbane central business district addresses including 12 Creek Street and 215 Adelaide Street. It will lease 25,000 square metres of the 38,000 sq m 31 level tower fronting 123 Albert Street.
Rent was not disclosed but sources said the miner would be paying at least $600 a sq m. Rio
""Laing O'Rourke has won the contract to build the tower.""
Tinto has taken a 10 year lease term and completion of the tower is not expected until late 2010.
This new Brisbane Rio Tinto office will bring all of our people together and make it easier to work effectively and efficiently, to share information and ideas and to attract new people to our business,"" said Rio Tinto Alcan's president and chief executive officer, bauxite and alumina, Steve Hodgson.
Irish builder Laing O'Rourke has won the contract to build the tower, which comprises 23 levels of office space, eight levels of car parking and retail outlets. Brisbane City Council has just approved the",ham

Coastal Life
Surrounding you is one of the rarest and most endangered ecosystems in the world.
Along with coastal California and Baja California, the Coastal Mediterranean ecosystem occurs only in the Mediterranean basin, and the southwestern coasts of South Africa, Chile, and Australia. Because the climate is mild and there is ready access to the ocean's resources, people find these regions good places to live and work.
Plants and animals that live here have evolved to live in a climate where sparse rain falls mostly in winter and spring. Plants have developed ways to store and reduce moisture loss during the dry season-some have tough, leathery leaves or tiny white hairs that reflect sunlight. Others dry out or go dormant during the summer, becoming renewed with winter rain. Deep and wide roots trap water and hold soil in place.
As you walk along the Kelp Forest and Whale Overlook Loop trail, look for changes in the kinds of plants you see. Even within a small area, subtle differences, such as exposure to light and moisture caused by slight elevation, orientation and slope changes, will encourage some plants to grow more than others.

or scavenging.

Falco peregrinus
A Success Story

Good day to you,
I've always had trouble with my weight ever since I was young.
Of course I tried all the ""best"" fat loss products, nothing helped very much.
It wasn't til I tried Anatrim that I saw the pounds seriously start to melt away!
Nothing helped me lose weight faster.
I literally saw 15 pounds melt away within the first few weeks!
There's nothing more exciting than watching pounds disappear,
especially when you've tried all sorts of different methods and products before.
I've since read up on Anatrim and am amazed at the number of people who have benefited from its amazing results.
I'm halfway to my goal, Anatrim will get me the rest of the way ;)
* Losing weight has never been so easy!
* Anatrim will change your life!

Good day to you,
I've always had trouble with my weight ever since I was young.
Of course I tried all the ""best"" fat loss products, nothing helped very much.
It wasn't til I tried Anatrim that I saw the pounds seriously start to melt away!
Nothing helped me lose weight faster.
I literally saw 15 pounds melt away within the first few weeks!
There's nothing more exciting than watching pounds disappear,
especially when you've tried all sorts of different methods and products before.
I've since read up on Anatrim and am amazed at the number of people who have benefited from its amazing results.
I'm halfway to my goal, Anatrim will get me the rest of the way :)
* Losing weight has never been so easy!
* Anatrim will change your life!

Good day to you,
I've always had trouble with my weight ever since I was young.
Of course I tried all the ""best"" fat loss products, nothing helped very much.
It wasn't til I tried Anatrim that I saw the pounds seriously start to melt away!
Nothing helped me lose weight faster.
I literally saw 15 pounds melt away within the first few weeks!
There's nothing more exciting than watching pounds disappear,
especially when you've tried all sorts of different methods and products before.
I've since read up on Anatrim and am amazed at the number of people who have benefited from its amazing results.
I'm halfway to my goal, Anatrim will get me the rest of the way :)
Losing weight has never been so easy!
Anatrim will change your life!

About 21,000 pairs of gannets live on the Bass Rock among rich feeding grounds. These birds have a brilliant white plumage with black wing-tips, and can be seen diving steeply into the sea with their wings folded.
Fulmars nest on the cliffs below the castle. Cousins of the albatross, they wheel and turn above the cliff-
face, or hover in an
in an updraft on long, stiff wings. Young and adult fulmars defend themselves by coughing smelly oil to a distance of several feet.
The cliffs also provide nesting sites for house martins. As they dart by, catching insects on the wing, note the characteristic flash of their white rumps.
Family creches of brown eider ducks are a common sight on the sea near the castle, diving for mussels around the rocks at the base of the cliffs. The black and white males
moult to a brown plumage in the summer months and congregate in bachelor parties offshore.

WILD BRUSH RELEASES CORPORATE UPDATE! SEATTLE, WA (MARKET WIRE)-Aug 30, 2006- Wild Brush Energy (Other
OTC:WBRS.PK - News) continues to expand its presence and acreage in the strategic Powder River Basin. The Company remains focused and committed to the Basin region with its fifth Federal Oil & Gas lease acquisition earlier in the month.
Proven reserves in the Basin region and the success of associate drilling programs have provided Wild Brush Energy with an optimistic and confident outlook here. More than 330 billion cubic feet of gas is being produced annually in an area with an estimated 32 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. With over 400 new wells being drilled each month and up to 90,000 more predicted the Powder River remains one of the most exciting gas plays in North America.
Wild Brush is committed to the evaluation and assessment of additional lease programs and purchase opportunities as they arise. The Company has confidence in its long-term commitment and strategy in the Basin area, and will continue to focus and develop in the best interests of Wild Brush Energy and its shareholders.
Wyoming Properties
In addition to the five Powder River leases, Wild Brush has another lease located in Wyoming's Green River Basin, which according to the Bureau of Land Management contains 1,162 million barrels of recoverable oil and 43.6 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. The Company's seventh lease is located in the Bighorn Basin, one of the most active natural gas areas in Wyoming.
Proven reserves of natural gas in Wyoming are at an all time high of nearly 19 trillion cubic feet, while proven reserves of crude oil are close to 500 million barrels. Collectively over 26,000 wells produced 54.7 million barrels of oil and 1.75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in Wyoming annually.

Information within this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21B of the SEC Act of 1934. Statements that involve discussions with respect to projections of future events are forward looking. Don't rely on them. This company doesn't report. Past performance is never indicative of future results. He received 150,000 free trading shares in the past. All those shares have been sold. He have received an additional 230,000 free trading shares now. The two tranches were from different third Parties: not affiliates. We intend to sell all 230,000 shares now, which could cause the stock to go down. This company has: nominal cash and no revenues in its most recent quarter. It is not an operating company. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. A failure to finance could cause the company to go out of business. This is a high risk security.

Make no mistake, our mission at BullsEye Financial is to sift through the thousands of underperforming companies out there to find the golden needle in the haystack. The micro-cap diamond that can make you a fortune. More often than not, the stocks we profile show a significant increase in stock price, sometimes in days or hours, not months or years. We have come across what we feel is one of those rare deals that the public has not heard about yet.

Coal: It's Dangerous It's Dirty, and It's the Future of Clean Energy
BY CHARLES C. NANN
IN TIANJIN'S HYPER-INDUSTRIALIZED zone, its highways choked with tracks, stand scores of factories and utility plants, each a mass of pipes, reactors, valves, vents, crackers, blowers, and distillation towers. Among these edifices, just as big and almost as anonymous as its neighbors, is a structure called GreenGen. By Western standards, it is a secretive place weeks of repeated requests for a tour met with no reply. When I visited anyway, guards not only refused admittance but wouldn't even confirm its name. As I drove away, a window blind cracked operc through the slats, an eye surveyed my departure. The silence is foolish, GreenGen, part of a coming wave of carbon-eating facilities, may be China's-and possibly the worlds-most consequential effort to fight climate change, STORY ON PAGE 72

Good day to you,
I've always had trouble with my weight ever since I was young.
Of course I tried all the ""best"" fat loss products, nothing helped very much.
It wasn't til I tried Anatrim that I saw the pounds seriously start to melt away!
Nothing helped me lose weight faster.
I literally saw 15 pounds melt away within the first few weeks!
There's nothing more exciting than watching pounds disappear,
especially when you've tried all sorts of different methods and products before.
I've since read up on Anatrim and am amazed at the number of people who have benefited from its amazing results.
I'm halfway to my goal, Anatrim will get me the rest of the way ;)
Losing weight has never been so easy!
Anatrim will change your life!

The site is designated within Site Specific Proposal 21 of the Haringey Plan as suitable for comprehensive mixed use development.
The draft Haringey Urban Character Study identified the Apex Corner site as a 'weak node', or a site in need of a landmark building.
From the section 'building height recommendations':
Opportunity to mark the important node (where Seven Sisters Road and the High Road meet) with an elegant, slim tower that can successfully mark this activity node. This tower could rise to circa 20 storeys but would need to form part of a lower rise (4-6 storeys) perimeter block and care taken to ensure wind vortexes are not created around its base, negatively impacting upon the public space.
The High Road is a sensitive, historic street where heights should respect the existing scale and grain of between 3-4 storeys with perhaps one or two recessed additional floors. New development should also respect the pattern of building widths which gives the street its visual interest.
From the section 'socioeconomic and cultural character':
High Road - along its length there is a near continuous (though with breaks) run of ground floor shops, cafes, businesses etc. - often with residential above. This stacking of uses gives the High Road its intensity, vibrancy and character. Along sections there are a number of splendid rows of townhouses (Page Green Terrace) as well as some poorer quality modern residential buildings that fail to successfully address the High Road.",ham

ISLAND OF CURIOSITIES
easily with attention found out by physicians' who asked 'proper ques- tions'. A 'lusty negro footman' named Emanuel had been ordered to help intercept some pirates carrying looted silver but 'pretended' to be sick and begged off by 'dissembling himself in a great agony'. Sloane 'questioned him about his pain' or, rather, questioned his pain: either this was some 'new strange disease' or typical black dishonesty. Having evidently absorbed the instinctive violence towards slaves of his planter hosts, Sloane sent for a 'frying-pan with burning coals' to be applied to Emanuel's head and 'candles to be lit at his hands and feet' - a tactic that mimicked whites' methods for torturing and executing slaves. In his telling, Sloane found both Emanuel's resistance and capitulation equally risible: he suddenly recovered and resumed work. Mental dis- tress figures in Sloane's case histories as well, though here again they are blind to the plight of the enslaved. An African woman called Rose had become 'melancholy' and 'morose' and also refused to work. 'She would not speak to any body, would not eat nor drink, except when fore'd' and 'would forget what her commands were'. If one put a broom in her hands to sweep the house, there she stood with it, looking on the ground very pensive and melancholy'. Sloane tried herbal decoctions, cupping, scarification and purging with emetics 'forc'd down her throat'. The scene is highly troubling: Sloane trying to 'cure' resistance to slavery. Some refused such cures outright. A slave named Isaac insisted to Sloane that 'say what I could... he would not recover' - and so he died. ""The passions of the mind,' Sloane blandly reflected, 'both hope and fear, have a very great influence on the body.' Nowhere in the case histories does he acknowledge the miseries suffered by the enslaved. While he ministered with care and respect to white alcoholics, he scorned slaves' troubles and sought to force them back to work for his planter friends.21
Case histories were classically construed as empirical observations of the facts of individual medical biographies, but this did not stop Sloane from passing judgement on a range of issues, and asserting his medical authority in the process. Contradicting his rival Thomas Trap- ham, he declared that he 'never saw a disease in Jamaica, which I had not met with in Europe', so there was no reason he couldn't treat them as well as anyone else, no matter how recently he had arrived. He talked up the utility of the Peruvian bark for fevers, 'in very great disrepute here' but which he favoured, to relieve fever and produce a perfect
